# Sagittarius Minecraft Limbo
Sagittarius is a Minecraft Limbo software designed to run smoothly on all versions. The name originated from the black hole Sagittarius A* which also describes how a limbo works: It just silently swallows all interactions with it.
Compared to most limbos this one will support map loading from worldedit schematics. That way your players will feel comfortable while waiting to be connected back.
The entirety of this project is still work in progress.

## Planned features
- [ ] WorldEdit map loading
- [ ] BungeeCord IP-Forwarding support
- [ ] Support for player skins
- [ ] Connect players to the lobby when they move
- [ ] ViaVersion for multi-version support
